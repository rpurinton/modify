    "help": "🤖 **Modify Help Guide**\n\nModify is here to keep your Discord server safe! Here's how to get started:\n\n🔗 **Support Server:** [Join the Modify Support Server](https://discord.gg/vYuTwaZ999)\n\n🔑 **Command: /log_channel**\nUse this command to designate a channel where Modify will send alerts for messages flagged for containing hate speech, threats, harassment, self-harm, sexual content, or violence.\n\n**Setting Up Your Log Channel:**\n1. Create a new channel (or choose an existing one) for Modify alerts.\n2. Ensure Modify has permission to send messages there.\n3. Enter `/log_channel` in the designated channel to set it as your log channel.\n\n✨ That's it! Modify will now send notifications to your log channel if a message gets flagged. Remember, you need 'manage server' permissions to set the log channel.\n\n🚀 *Future Plans:*\n- Custom threshold levels for content categories.\n- Tailored policies for different channels and roles.\n- Punishment policies for repeated violations.\n\nStay tuned for updates!\n\nNeed more help? **Thank you for using Modify! Let's create a safe community together.**\n\n🧹 **Command: /purge**\nUse this command to bulk delete messages in a channel. You can specify the number of messages to delete (1-100), filter by content, user, messages from apps, or messages containing embeds.\n\n**How to Use /purge:**\n- `/purge amount:<number>` — Delete up to 100 recent messages.\n- Optional: Add filters like `contains:<text>`, `user:<user>`, `apps:true`, or `embeds:true` to target specific messages.\n- You need 'manage messages' permission to use this command.\n",
